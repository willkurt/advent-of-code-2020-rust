# Advent of Code 2020 - Rust

This repo is the code I've been using to answer the puzzles in the 2020, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

I've decided to take this as an oppurnity to learn Rust, which has been incredibly fun so far.

However, do note that I've only written Rust for 1 day prior to starting this project so the code samples here should not be taken as anything other than experiments in learning Rust. Some of the solutions (day 4 for example) run very slow.

Nonetheless this has been a great experiment in learning what is quickly becoming one of my absolute favorite languages. One I am finished I might use this space to elaborate a bit more on what I learned about Rust along the way!
